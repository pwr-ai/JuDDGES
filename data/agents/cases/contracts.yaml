  Here's my response:

  1. I think you're looking to create a structured way to retrieve data from contracts. Can you confirm that?

  2. What type of contracts are you primarily dealing with (e.g., employment contracts, business agreements, lease agreements)?

  3. When you say "contract value", do you mean the total monetary amount agreed upon in the contract, or other financial details such as payment schedules, interest rates, or penalties?

  4. Regarding the parties involved, would you like to extract information about the individuals signing the contract, companies, or both?

  5. Idea: would you also like to extract dates associated with the contract, such as the effective date, termination date, or renewal dates?

  6. Are there any specific clauses or sections within the contracts that you'd like to prioritize extracting information from (e.g., confidentiality agreements, warranties, dispute resolution processes)?

  7. How do you envision using the extracted information? For example, will it be used for analytics, reporting, compliance, or something else? 

  Please let me know so I can better understand your requirements!
